# Multi-Agent Chess

## Description
Multi-Agent Chess is a chess-playing program built on JADE (Java Agent Development Framework). Each chess piece is represented as an agent capable of communicating with a central "Robot" agent. The program demonstrates multi-agent systems and intelligent agent interactions. The graphical interface allows users to visualize the legal moves for each piece.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the project into your Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` class to start the JADE container.
4. The graphical chess board will appear, and you can begin playing.

## Agents
- Robot Agent: Central agent that communicates with chess piece agents and highlights legal moves.
- Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King Agents: Agents representing individual chess pieces.

## Rules
The agents follow the standard chess rules for legal moves.
